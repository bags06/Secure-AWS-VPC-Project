#  Secure AWS VPC Architecture 

In this project I  build a **secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** on AWS using only **free-tier resources**. The architecture includes **segmented public and private subnets**, strict access controls using **Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs)**. For enhanced security monitoring, I also enabled AWS GuardDuty for threat detection and set up CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instance metrics and logs. These services help detect unusual behavior and maintain visibility into the environment.

## 🌐 Architecture Overview

-  Custom VPC (`10.0.0.0/16`)
-  Public Subnet: Public Host EC2 (SSH entry point)
-  Private Subnet: Private Instance EC2 (only accessible from public host)
-  Internet Gateway (for outbound access from public subnet)
-  Route Tables for subnet separation
-  Security Groups and NACLs for controlled traffic flow
-  VPC Flow Logs configured (via CloudWatch Logs)
-  GuardDuty enabled for threat detection

## 🧱 Project Components

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **VPC**          | Custom IPv4 VPC with DNS hostname support |
| **Subnets**      | Public (`10.0.1.0/24`), Private (`10.0.2.0/24`) |
| **EC2 Instances**| 1 Public ( public host instance), 1 Private (private instance ), both `t2.micro` |
| **Routing**      | Internet access via Internet gateway for public subnet; no direct internet for private subnet |
| **Security Groups** | Allow SSH to bastion from my IP; SSH to private only from public host |
| **NACLs**        | Stateless layer blocking all by default except essential traffic |
| **Monitoring**   | VPC Flow Logs + GuardDuty enabled for visibility (basic setup) |

## 🔐 Security Measures

-  **Public EC2** allows SSH only from my IP address
-  **Private EC2** is not publicly accessible; only the public host instance can connect via SSH
-  **NACLs** block all unnecessary traffic to/from both subnets
-  **VPC Flow Logs** provide traffic visibility via CloudWatch Logs
-  **GuardDuty** enables passive threat detection
